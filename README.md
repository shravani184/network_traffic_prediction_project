* Configurable training via YAML file
* Custom evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE)
* Model saving and loading
* Visualization of predicted vs actual values
* Inference time measurement

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* YAML
* Scikit-learn

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd traffic_prediction_project
```

### 2. Create and activate virtual environment

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Project

### Train the model

Run from the project root directory:

```
python src/train.py
```

This will train the model and save it to:

```
artifacts/model.pt
```

---

### Run prediction and evaluation

```
python src/predict.py
```

This will:

* Load the trained model
* Evaluate it on test data
* Print performance metrics (MSE, MAE)
* Display prediction plots

---

## Configuration

All configurable parameters are stored in:

```
config.yaml
```

This includes:

* Dataset parameters
* Batch size
* Learning rate
* Number of epochs
* Device (CPU/GPU)

---

## Sample Output

```
Model Evaluation Metrics:
-------------------------
MSE: 0.0023
MAE: 0.0345
Inference Time: 0.5123 seconds
-------------------------
```

---

## Model Architecture

* CNN layers extract spatial features from input data
* LSTM layers capture temporal dependencies
* Attention mechanism highlights important time steps

---

## Notes

* Always run scripts from the project root directory
* Ensure `config.yaml` is present in the root folder
* The trained model will be saved automatically after training

---

## Future Work

* Real-time traffic prediction system
* Web-based dashboard for visualization
* Hyperparameter tuning and optimization
* Deployment as an API or application
